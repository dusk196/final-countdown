## A small app to keep track of the upcoming events that you're excited about

[**DEMO**: https://how-many-days.netlify.app/](https://how-many-days.netlify.app/)

Okay, how many times you had to count the number of days remaining for any special day that you're excited about, and then some days later you completely forgot about it? ðŸ˜œ

Tell you what, I'm a Bengali and I always get super excited for Durga Puja! It usually starts with some random Facebook posts like "100 days remaining..." and I start syncing up  the number of days only to forget the track of days eventually after few days. ðŸ˜œ

Here comes "How Many Days" in the picture where you can set a countdown and check it whenever you like!

The idea is based on one of my very close friends, [Moithil's](https://github.com/moithil) Durga Puja countdown timer with a brand new UI and loads of other features.

Suggestions are highly appreciated!
